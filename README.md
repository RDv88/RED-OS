🔴 RED-OS is a comprehensive technological suite for Minecraft, designed to automate logistics, enhance security, and master spatial energy. No longer just a collection of machines, it is a unified operating system for your world.

## 🛰 How it Works: Discovery & Progression

In Survival mode, RED-OS utilizes an advancement-based unlock system. Hardware tiers are unlocked as soon as the required items are detected in your inventory.

* **Tier 1 (Base Technology):** Automatically unlocks when a `Clock` and `Redstone Torch` are detected in your inventory. Grants access to basic networking, cameras, and sensors.
* **Tier 2 (Advanced Spatial):** Requires Tier 1 completion and discovery of an `Echo Shard`. Unlocks the Quantum Porter and Plasma Disintegrator.

> **Note:** For architects, all features are immediately available in **Creative Mode** by searching for **RED-OS**.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Autonomous Drone Logistics:** Deploy intelligent Drone Units to move items through complex Mesh networks.
*   **Quantum Teleportation:** Master the Quantum Porter system for instant long-range logistics and travel.
*   **Centralized Handheld OS:** Control your entire network from a single, high-tech Handheld Device.
*   **Surveillance & Security:** Monitor your base with Wireless IP Cameras and Smart Motion Sensors.
*   **Defense Systems:** Protect your infrastructure with the Plasma Pulse Disintegrator.
