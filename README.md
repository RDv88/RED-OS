## 🔴 RED-OS: Advanced Technology Ecosystem (BETA)

RED-OS is a comprehensive technological suite for Minecraft, designed to automate logistics, enhance security, and master spatial energy. No longer just a collection of machines, it is a unified operating system for your world.


## 🚀 Key Features

**Centralized Handheld OS**:
Take absolute control with the Handheld Device. This powerful multi-app tablet serves as the primary interface for your infrastructure, allowing you to
configure hardware, monitor fleet status, and manage security protocols from the palm of your hand.

**Global Communication Suite**:
The ultimate command center for player interaction. Features a high-performance Global Chat, an encrypted Private Messenger Vault for persistent local history,
and a seamless Discord Bridge to connect your in-game world with your external community in real-time.

**Autonomous Drone Logistics**:
Deploy intelligent Drone Units managed by a centralized Master Controller. These autonomous agents navigate complex Mesh Networks to transport resources with
high efficiency, featuring built-in survival protocols and intelligent back-pressure detection for full containers.

**Surveillance & Advanced Security**:
Maintain total situational awareness with high-definition Wireless IP Cameras and Smart Sensors. Monitor your facility through real-time video feeds
and configure automated alerts for players, entities, or specific network events.

**Quantum Teleportation Infrastructure**:
Master the Quantum Porter system for instantaneous long-range logistics and personnel travel. Utilizing advanced spatial mapping, the Porter provides secure,
zero-latency movement across your entire RED-OS network.

**High-Energy Defense**:
Protect your assets with the Plasma Pulse Disintegrator weapon.


## 🛰 How it Works: Discovery & Progression

In Survival mode, RED-OS utilizes an advancement-based unlock system. Hardware tiers are unlocked as soon as the required items are detected in your inventory.

* **Tier 1 (Base Technology):** Automatically unlocks when a `Clock` and `Redstone Torch` are detected in your inventory. Grants access to basic networking, cameras, and sensors.
* **Tier 2 (Advanced Spatial):** Requires Tier 1 completion and discovery of an `Echo Shard`. Unlocks the Quantum Porter and Plasma Disintegrator.

> **Note:** For architects, all features are immediately available in **Creative Mode** by searching for **RED-OS**.
